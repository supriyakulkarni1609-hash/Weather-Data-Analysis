# Weather Data Analysis – Internship Task 1

## Project Overview
This project performs weather data analysis using Python.
The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, monthly temperature analysis, and rainfall prediction using Linear Regression, following the instructions provided by the organization.

---

## Technologies Used
* Python (version 3.6 or higher)
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

---

## Dataset
* File name: `weather.csv`
* The dataset contains historical weather data used for analysis.
* Ensure that the dataset file is located in the same directory as the Python script.

---

## Provided Instructions (As Given)

### 1. Requirements

* Python (>= 3.6)
* Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### 2. Dataset

* The analysis is performed on the `weather.csv` dataset. Ensure that this CSV file is in the same directory as the Python script or provide the correct file path in the code.

### 3. Running the Python Script

* Save the Python code in a `.py` file (for example, `weather_data_analysis.py`).
* Open the terminal or command prompt.
* Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

### 4. Install Required Libraries

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

### 5. Execute the Python Script

```bash
python weather_data_analysis.py
```

### 6. Analysis Steps

* Data exploration
* Data visualization
* Feature engineering 
* Data analysis
* Additional data visualization
* Advanced analysis (rainfall prediction using Linear Regression)
* Conclusions and insights

### 7. Customization

* The script can be customized by adding new features or modifying analysis steps.

### 8. Save or Display Results

* Results are displayed in the terminal and through visual plots.

### 9. Additional Work (Optional)

* Further analysis or improvements can be considered as future work.
